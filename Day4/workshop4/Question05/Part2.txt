Part 2: Draw the memory map when the program runs [3 points]
Explain step by step what happened when the program runs and answer some questions.
- What is stored in the static heap, stack, dynamic heap?
- What are objects in the program?
- What is the item variable storing?
- Why must you cast to call the method inputVase()/outputVase()?
- What is the error thrown when you cast it wrong?
- What methods can you call if you donâ€™t cast the item variable?

The only object declared in the program is item.
The item variable storing null value.
Because the currently type of item is `Item`
Methods can be called without casting:
- getValue
- setValue
- getCreator
- setCreator
- input
- output
